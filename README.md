## Experiment 3 - PANDAS
Before continuing to the problems we have to access the pandas library by inputing the code function below.</br>

#### Problem 1
##### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas. </br>
After downloading the given cars file, to load it on our notebook we have to use the pandas code read_csv so we could view the given csv file.</br>

Running this code would make us able to observe the given file shown on the image below </br>

##### b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.</br>
After successfully loading the csv file, we now have to load the first 5 rows and we can do that by using the pandas code heads(5) shown on the image below.</br>

And now to load the last 5 rows we will be using the pandas code tail(5) shown on the image below.</br>

#### Problem 
By using the dataframe cars  in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and
indexing operations.</br>

##### a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7â€¦) of cars.
To display the first odd 5 columns we have to access the rows and columns
